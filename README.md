<h1>Echoes of the future Version 0.13.5 </h1>

A work-in-progress Cobalt Core mod. Requires Kokoro, and nickle.

Angder is a dark blue wolf, who's personality is best described as a golden retriever with a knife. He loves violence and combat. Angder's Robotic friend, D26, is also along for the ride. D26 is a Robotic maid, who definitely does not have homicidial intentions.


Everything about this mod is subject to change as I nail down the balance, and fix all the bugs. Right now I think he plays well enough to release to the public, but he is far from complete.

Huge thanks to: **Shockah,** **Arin,** and **TheJazMaster** for help coding this pack.

Also special thanks to **Soggoru Waffle** for giving me some art that will likely be less temporary than most of the other bits present. (the art in question being the Icons used for "cleave" and "long cleave")
