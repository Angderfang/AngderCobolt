<h1>ANGDER Version 0.9.1 </h1>

A work-in-progress Cobalt Core mod. Requires Kokoro.

Angder is a dark blue wolf, who's personality is best described as a golden retriever with a knife. He loves violence, combat, and is extremely aggressive because of this.


Everything about this mod is subject to change as I nail down the balance, and fix all the bugs. Right now I think he plays well enough to release to the public, but he is far from complete.

Huge thanks to: **Shockah,** **Arin,** and **TheJazMaster** for help coding this character.

Also special thanks to **Soggoru Waffle** for giving me some art that will likely be less temporary than most of the other bits present. (the art in question being the Icons used for "cleave" and "long cleave"
